ESPHome powered Home Assistant control panel using the popular Cheap Yellow Display (ESP32-2432S028).

A 3D-printable enclosure with adjustable tilt for an ESP32 2.8" ILI9341 touchscreen, powered by ESPHome + LVGL and integrated with Home Assistant.  
Includes ready-to-flash YAML configs for the ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display), a standalone ILI9341 + external ESP32 wiring variant, and the Guition JC4827W543 smart display.

Multiple mounting options are supported:

- Desk Mount – for tabletop installation
- Under-Desk Mount – for installation underneath a desk or shelf
- Wall Mount – for wall installation (CYD version only)
- Flush Mount – for in-wall installation (EU electrical box compatible)

The enclosure can therefore be used as a compact Home Assistant control panel for desks, walls, or mounted underneath furniture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ESP32-2432S028 Cheap Yellow Display is transformed into a tiltable Home Assistant control panel powered by ESPHome and LVGL.

The goal of this project is to create a clean, wall- or desk-mounted smart control panel that integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant.  
It features a modern LVGL-based UI, real-time state synchronization, and optional direct Home Assistant service calls.

The enclosure is designed for:

- Clean cable routing  
- Adjustable viewing angle (±35° tilt)  
- Minimal footprint  
- Professional, integrated appearance  

Three hardware variants are supported:

- ✅ **ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display / CYD)**
- ✅ **Standalone ILI9341 + External ESP32 wiring variant**
- ✅ **Guition JC4827W543 (ESP32-S3 + NV3041A + GT911)**

The ESP32-2432S028 integrates the ESP32, ILI9341 display, touchscreen controller, and backlight circuitry on a single board.  
It is commonly known as the **Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)** in the maker community and is the easiest option for this project.

Note: The video quality looks worse than in real life because the display refresh rate interferes with the camera frame rate when filming the screen. In reality the UI looks much smoother and cleaner.

# 🆕 Architecture Overview (LVGL-Based UI)

This project uses ESPHome LVGL instead of a classic display lambda approach.

### Core Concepts

- UI rendered fully using LVGL widgets
- 4 configurable touch buttons
- Real-time state mirroring from Home Assistant
- Central `ui_refresh` script keeps UI synchronized
- Optional direct Home Assistant service calls
- Action sensor for automation-based control

### Two Control Modes

#### 1️⃣ Direct Mode (Default – Plug & Play)

If `DIRECT_ACTIONS` is set to `"true"` (default):

- Touch publishes an action string
- AND directly calls a Home Assistant service  
  (default: `light.toggle`)

No Home Assistant automations required.

#### 2️⃣ Automation Mode

If `DIRECT_ACTIONS` is set to `"false"`:

- Touch ONLY publishes an action string
- You implement behavior in Home Assistant automations

Trigger example:
```
Entity: sensor.smartdisplay_action
To: btn1_press
```

### Overlay Control Layer

The UI contains a secondary overlay layer used for interactive controls.

When a tile is long-pressed:

1. The overlay opens
2. The control type is determined (brightness / percentage / cover position)
3. Slider interaction updates Home Assistant
4. Closing the overlay returns to the tile grid

This keeps the tile UI clean while still allowing detailed control.


# ⚙️ Requirements

- Home Assistant installed
- ESPHome Add-on installed
- ESPHome 2026.4+
- Home Assistant 2026.2+
- Basic ESPHome knowledge
- 3D printer access (optional)

---

# 🧪 Tested With

This project was tested using:

- **ESPHome 2026.2+**
- **Home Assistant 2026.2+**
- ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display / CYD)
- ILI9341 + XPT2046 standalone wiring variant
- Guition JC4827W543 (ESP32-S3 + NV3041A + GT911)

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT -- Enable "Actions" in Home Assistant

Because this project uses:

```
homeassistant.action → light.toggle
```

You must allow the ESPHome device to perform Home Assistant service calls.

### How to enable:

1. Open Home Assistant  
2. Go to **Settings**  
3. Click **Devices & Services**  
4. Open the **ESPHome integration**  
5. Select your device  
6. Enable:

> "Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions"

Without this setting, direct control will not work.

### Power connection (CYD)

For the mount enclosure the side USB connector of the CYD is **not used**.

Instead the included power cable can be used.  
The **red and black wires provide 5V and GND** and can easily be connected to an old USB-A cable.

Typical setup:

1. Cut an old USB cable
2. Connect **5V (red)** and **GND (black)** to the CYD power cable
3. Route the cable through the enclosure
4. Solder or use small wire connectors

This keeps the enclosure compact and avoids having a visible or protruding USB connector on the side.

If the USB port was used directly, the enclosure would need to be wider or the connector would remain visible.

⚠️ Important: The CYD often has multiple identical JST connectors, but they do not share the same pinout. Make sure to use the connector labeled VIN / 5V. Other connectors may be labeled 3.3V, and connecting 5V there can damage the board.

- `esphome/buttons/jc4827w543/buttons.yaml` – lockscreen with 4 round buttons for JC4827W543

> Tip: The `home-like.yaml` file uses orientation-specific background images located in `esphome/home-like/images/`.
> For a full reference of all tile substitutions and copy-paste examples, see [`esphome/home-like/TILE_CONFIGURATION.md`](esphome/home-like/TILE_CONFIGURATION.md).
> Two images are included:
> - `smartdisplay_background.png` — used for 0° (landscape) and 180° (landscape flipped)
> - `smartdisplay_background_90.png` — used for 90° (portrait) and 270° (portrait flipped)
>
> The active image is selected via the `BG_IMAGE` substitution in the ORIENTATION preset block.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assets (required for the UI)
- **Material Design Icons font**: `materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` is included in each UI variant's `fonts/` folder (Apache 2.0 license, sourced from [Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont)).
  - If you change icons in the YAML, ensure the glyph list contains them.
- **Background images (home-like UI)**:
  - `esphome/home-like/images/smartdisplay_background.png` — landscape (0° and 180°), included.
  - `esphome/home-like/images/smartdisplay_background_90.png` — portrait (90° and 270°), included.
  - Selected automatically via the `BG_IMAGE` substitution in the ORIENTATION preset block.
# ⚙️ UI mapping (USER CONFIG)

Your config choice defines the UI style:

## `buttons.yaml` (lockscreen like buttons)
- Buttons: BTN1..BTN4
- Action strings: `btn1_press` .. `btn4_press`
- Default direct action (if `DIRECT_ACTIONS: "true"`): `light.toggle` on `BTN*_ENTITY`

<img src="images/display-buttons.png" width="50%">


## `home-like.yaml` (tiles)
- Tiles: TILE1..TILE6
- Action strings: `tile1_press` .. `tile6_press` (short tap), `tile1_long_press` .. `tile6_long_press` (long press)
- Each tile can optionally call a Home Assistant service directly (e.g. light toggle, fan preset toggle, cover open/close or cover position).
- Per-tile OFF label is configurable via `TILE*_LABEL_OFF` (e.g. "Off" / "Aus").

### Long-Press Behavior

Each tile's long-press mode is configured via `TILE*_LONGPRESS`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `slider` | Opens a value overlay (brightness / fan speed / cover position) |
| `action` | Fires a different HA entity than the short tap |
| `none` | Only publishes the `tileN_long_press` event, no direct action |

**Slider mode** — configure with `TILE*_LONGPRESS_SLIDER` and `TILE*_LONGPRESS_OFF_VALUE`:

| Tile Type | Overlay Control |
|-----------|----------------|
| light     | Brightness slider |
| fan       | Speed / percentage slider |
| cover     | Position slider |

**Action mode** — configure with `TILE*_LONGPRESS_ACTION`, `TILE*_LONGPRESS_ACTION_TYPE`, and optionally `TILE*_LONGPRESS_ACTION_SERVICE`. The action entity can be a completely different entity than the short tap target — useful for e.g. triggering a scene or script on long press while toggling a light on short press.

In all modes, the `tileN_long_press` event is always published to `sensor.smartdisplay_action` so Home Assistant automations can react to it independently.

<img src="images/display-home-like-overlay.png" width="50%">

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 System Flow

### Direct Mode

1. Button pressed  
2. Action string published  
3. Home Assistant service called  
4. Entity state updated  
5. Mirrored back into ESPHome  
6. UI refreshed  

### Automation Mode

1. Button pressed  
2. Action string published  
3. Home Assistant automation triggers  
4. Automation controls device  
5. State mirrored back  


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔧 Customization

For most setups, you only need to edit the **USER CONFIG / substitutions** section in the YAML.

You can also:

-   Add more buttons / pages
-   Change service calls (the default is `light.toggle`)
-   Modify fonts and icon glyphs
-   Adjust colors / theme
-   Date localization can be adjusted in the ui_refresh script (days[] / months[] arrays).
-   Adjust transforms for your panel

If touch alignment is wrong, ensure `display.transform` and `touchscreen.transform`
are **identical** (they must always match).

### White screen after ESPHome update (2026.4+)

If the display stays **completely white** after updating ESPHome but the device still connects to Home Assistant, the cause is a breaking change in ESPHome 2026.4: the `ili9xxx` display platform was deprecated in favor of `mipi_spi`.

The YAML configs in this repo already use `mipi_spi`. If you are on an **older ESPHome version (before 2026.4)** and `mipi_spi` is not available yet, change the display platform back to `ili9xxx` and add `color_palette: 8BIT`:

```yaml
display:
  - platform: ili9xxx
    model: ILI9341
    color_palette: 8BIT
    ...
```

Also re-add `miso_pin` to the LCD SPI bus:

```yaml
spi:
  - id: lcd
    clk_pin: GPIO14   # or GPIO18 for the external ESP32 variant
    mosi_pin: GPIO13  # or GPIO23
    miso_pin: GPIO12  # or GPIO19 — add this back for older ESPHome
```

### Corrupted / garbled display output

If the display shows **corrupted graphics, horizontal lines, or random pixels**, the most common cause is a **different display controller on your Cheap Yellow Display**.

Most CYD boards use **ILI9341**, but some variants ship with **ST7789** or **ILI9342**.  
If the driver in ESPHome does not match the controller, the display output may look broken.

Try changing the display model in the YAML:

```yaml
display:
  - platform: mipi_spi
    model: ILI9341
```

Alternative models that may work depending on your board:

```yaml
model: ST7789V
```

or

```yaml
model: ILI9342
```

Flashing with a different model is usually the fastest way to identify the correct controller.

---

### Display rotated / mirrored

If the UI appears **rotated, mirrored, or upside down**, use the built-in **ORIENTATION preset block** in the substitutions section at the top of `home-like.yaml`.

Four presets are provided and documented as comments — uncomment the one matching your desired orientation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) and comment out the others. Each preset sets the correct `DISPLAY_SWAP_XY`, `DISPLAY_MIRROR_X/Y`, `TOUCH_SWAP_XY`, `TOUCH_MIRROR_X/Y`, grid layout, and background image automatically.

> Note: touch calibration values (`TOUCH_CAL_*`) are device-specific. The portrait presets include approximate values that may need tuning after flashing.

If your board behaves differently from the presets, you can tune the transform values manually via the substitutions. The underlying parameters are:

```yaml
transform:
  swap_xy: true
  mirror_x: true
  mirror_y: true
```

Depending on the board variant, you may need to experiment with these values until the orientation matches your screen.
Make sure `display.transform` and `touchscreen.transform` always use the same values, otherwise touch input will be misaligned.
